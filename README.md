Many thanks to the Git repository https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/3D-Graphics-Engine and corresponding YT video, which provided the shader program. The OOP structure of this is heavily inspired by their work.

This is a highly simplified 3D model of a solar system similar to our own, without the outer planets. 

Use the q, w, e, a, s, d keys to move the camera up (q), down (e), right (d), left (a), forward (w), and backward (s)

Moving the mouse will rotate the view

The following modules will need to be installed for code to run:
pip install pygame
            moderngl
            pywavefront
            pyglm
            numpy
